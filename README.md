# ðŸŽ¹ Dawsome

[WIP] A DAW build on React + Rust + WASM

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev`

Tauri will open a new window with the app in development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

See the section about [development](https://tauri.studio/docs/api/cli#dev) for more information.

To run the frontend separately from the backend, use `pnpm ui:start`.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
This builds the Tauri app bundle and correctly bundles React in production mode, optimizing the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [building](https://tauri.studio/docs/api/cli#build) for more information.

### `pnpm ui:test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/) for more information.
